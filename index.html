                <b>Guide to Flexbox</b>
            </h4>

            The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among
            items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex"). The main idea behind
            the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill
            the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container
            expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox
            layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which
            is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large
            or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).

            <h4>
                <b>Why Flexbox?</b>
            </h4>

            Why Flexbox? For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were things
            like floats and positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and
            frustrating. The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such
            tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way: Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent. Making
            all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much
            width/height is available.

                <b>Alternative to Floats</b>
            </h4>

            The “Flexible Box” or “Flexbox” layout mode offers an alternative to Floats for defining the overall appearance of a web
            page. Whereas floats only let us horizontally position our boxes, flexbox gives us complete control over the
            alignment, direction, order, and size of our boxes. The web is currently undergoing a major transition, so a
            little discussion around the state of the industry is warranted. For the last decade or so, floats were the sole
            option for laying out a complex web page.
